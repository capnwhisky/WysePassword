Dell Wyse Password Encode and Decode


I needed to Encode a password for our old (pre Dell) Wyse devices and no readily available software was still around to encode.

So I found a reverse engineered decoding (Thanks to https://github.com/pentestpartners/Password-Decoders/blob/master/wysedecode.c) and reversed that into an encoding tool as well. Feel free to use it and modify as needed.
